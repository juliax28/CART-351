                        <p> After the python introduction, I am looking forward to learning more about the language.
                            Having
                            already done classes where I worked in javascript, it seems like this will be fairly
                            similar.
                            I've already had a look at the worksheet, and I was able to finish most of the exercises
                            fairly quickly, so I'm hoping my positivity will stay throughout the rest of the semester!

                            After completing the first worksheet assignment, I am still pleased to say that I feel
                            as if python may be easier to get the hang of in some ways than Javascript. It is more
                            forgiving when it comes to syntax, and many of the functions we used in this particular
                            exercise are self explanatory. However, I am also curious to see how it deviates from
                            Javascript in the future, and I am looking forward to experimenting more with the
                            language in more creative ways.
                        </p>

                            At this moment, I have just finished the first 'in-class' assignment, which concentrated on
                            retrieving information from lists and dictionaries within an API. Although what we did was a
                            very simple exercise, I found it interesting to finally understand what an API was, and be
                            able to see how to access the information. Being able to access such enormous databases
                            through python is clearly incredibly powerful and opens up many avenues for productivity AND
                            creativity. So, while reading the first project outline, I became excited to explore these
                            creative avenues.

                            After the FLASK class, it's starting to make more sense to me how python can be used to make
                            interactive websites. Even
                            just the small amount of experimentation during the class time allowed some of these ideas
                            to finally click in my head.
                            Unfortunately, it seems like everyone is getting sick, and seeing that I was n exception I
                            was in a bit of a fog.
                            However, I will put extra effort into reviewing the information so that it sticks in my
                            mind. Good thing I've been
                            taking good notes!

                            Monday was the final submission for the first project/assignmnet, and all in all I think
                            that my sister and I did pretty well with the knowledge that we have so far. Using the
                            terminal as our main output srouce, we were required to use the information from the World
                            Weather API in order to create some interesting outputs. Since we are both more narrative
                            oriented people, we decided to make a sort of log from the perspective of a scientist gone
                            mad. As the player explores the entries, they uncover a story about the Dr. who has become
                            the machine, with the final log revealing that they have become the terminal... a "terminal
                            illness" some would say...
                            The text opens with asking for a password, name and then reveals the journal entries.
                            <img src="images/JournalEntries.png">
                            Then, each journal entry has it's own 'quirk', which is to say that an interesting occurence
                            happens that utilizes the web API's information in order to display something creative. For
                            example, the Dr. expresses that the screens around him begin to look like faces, which is
                            then follwoed by a nonsensical graph wherein ASCII art of faces appear. However, these faces
                            can change day by day, as they are based on AQI and UID.
                            <img src="images/screensLikeFaces.png" width="500" height="250"> </img>
                            This leads me to the fact that we ued both ASCII art and RICH to enhance the look and feel
                            of our small program, and I belive that implementing these small artistic expressions does
                            elevate the experience of playing through the short narrative.
                            Overall, I am quite happy with how the project went. We were fairly independent while
                            working on it, and only asked a few questions near the end (which is already a step up from
                            working in JavaScript last semester, might I add). Being able to implement a fun, creative
                            use to even a basic Python code did prove to be quite rewarding. :D
