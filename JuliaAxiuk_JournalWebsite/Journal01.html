                        <p> After the python introduction, I am looking forward to learning more about the language.
                            Having
                            already done classes where I worked in javascript, it seems like this will be fairly
                            similar.
                            I've already had a look at the worksheet, and I was able to finish most of the exercises
                            fairly quickly, so I'm hoping my positivity will stay throughout the rest of the semester!

                            After completing the first worksheet assignment, I am still pleased to say that I feel
                            as if python may be easier to get the hang of in some ways than Javascript. It is more
                            forgiving when it comes to syntax, and many of the functions we used in this particular
                            exercise are self explanatory. However, I am also curious to see how it deviates from
                            Javascript in the future, and I am looking forward to experimenting more with the
                            language in more creative ways.

                            At this moment, I have just finished the first 'in-class' assignment, which concentrated on
                            retrieving information from lists and dictionaries within an API. Although what we did was a
                            very simple exercise, I found it interesting to finally understand what an API was, and be
                            able to see how to access the information. Being able to access such enormous databases
                            through python is clearly incredibly powerful and opens up many avenues for productivity AND
                            creativity. So, while reading the first project outline, I became excited to explore these
                            creative avenues.

                            After the FLASK class, it's starting to make more sense to me how python can be used to make
                            interactive websites. Even
                            just the small amount of experimentation during the class time allowed some of these ideas
                            to finally click in my head.
                            Unfortunately, it seems like everyone is getting sick, and seeing that I was no exception I
                            was in a bit of a fog.
                            However, I will put extra effort into reviewing the information so that it sticks in my
                            mind. Good thing I've been taking good notes!

                            Monday was the final submission for the first project/assignmnet, and all in all I think
                            that my sister and I did pretty well with the knowledge that we have so far. Using the
                            terminal as our main output srouce, we were required to use the information from the World
                            Weather API in order to create some interesting outputs. Since we are both more narrative
                            oriented people, we decided to make a sort of log from the perspective of a scientist gone
                            mad. As the player explores the entries, they uncover a story about the Dr. who has become
                            the machine, with the final log revealing that they have become the terminal... a "terminal
                            illness" some would say...
                            The text opens with asking for a password, name and then reveals the journal entries.
                            <img src="images/JournalEntries.png">
                            Then, each journal entry has it's own 'quirk', which is to say that an interesting occurence
                            happens that utilizes the web API's information in order to display something creative. For
                            example, the Dr. expresses that the screens around him begin to look like faces, which is
                            then follwoed by a nonsensical graph wherein ASCII art of faces appear. However, these faces
                            can change day by day, as they are based on AQI and UID.
                            <img src="images/screensLikeFaces.png" width="500" height="250"> </img>
                            This leads me to the fact that we ued both ASCII art and RICH to enhance the look and feel
                            of our small program, and I belive that implementing these small artistic expressions does
                            elevate the experience of playing through the short narrative.
                            Overall, I am quite happy with how the project went. We were fairly independent while
                            working on it, and only asked a few questions near the end (which is already a step up from
                            working in JavaScript last semester, might I add). Being able to implement a fun, creative
                            use to even a basic Python code did prove to be quite rewarding. :D

                            Yesterday I handed in Exercise II, which dealt with combining FLASK with a JINJA template,
                            allowing us to display and work with FLASK information on a webpage. I had fun with this
                            exercise as I worked with my sister, as we tried to put some creativity into the visuals.
                            Moreover, learning how to fetch information from FLASK and display it using a template is
                            obviously incredibly useful, and I cna already understand how powerful of a tool it may be
                            for more complex website creation.

                            Things are getting more and more complex! In the third part of our FLASK classes, we were
                            taught ways to store session variables as well as create and submit forms. Cool! This adds
                            yet another layer of possibility for interactivity and complexity with the user.
                            Unfortunately, midterms have my mind a little scattered. Hopefully I can take the chance to
                            catch up on the information I may have missed/ clear up some information in FLASK part IV
                            next week.

                            STM strikes, post-halloween sadness and FLASK PART IV. One would think these thigns don't go
                            very well together, and yet, I found myself grasping the ideas in this class more easily
                            than last week. Being able to work with JSON files seems like it could be incredibly useful,
                            especially after having done projects where the information stored in JSON files played a
                            keu role, I am beginning to imagine a scenarion similar to said projects, only maybe with
                            some sort of dynamic/more interactive elements? Anyways, it's fun to think about.

                            Today I finally handed in project 02, which delt with all the aforementioned FLASK + PYTHON
                            + JSON functionaltiy from the last few weeks, minus Monday's MONGO class. Once again working
                            with my sister, we aimed to make something akin to a fortune-telling/horoscope reading
                            experience that used the user information in some way in order to give said fortune.
                            Although we went with something relatively simple, I thought it was executed in a fairly
                            succesful way. If I had more time, It would've been nice to elevate the experience by adding
                            more fortunes/ more artwork.
                            The project works simply: first, the user is asked to enter their name and the last two
                            digits of their birthyear. The program then converts the birthyear number into a chance%,
                            assigning a fortune then to that user. The fortune appears on the side in orange. If more
                            users input their information, the previous fortunes appear next tot he current orang one,
                            allowing for a collective display of everyone's information.

                            The player information + fortune is displayed from a JSON file that actively stores the
                            information after every turn, with
                            the orange and purple boxes taking said information to display.

                            We decided to take a more playful angle to the project, and I think it was pretty succesful
                            considering the chaos of this midterm season.

                            Last class was dedicated to two things; first, we were introduced to how to use websockets -
                            a way of having multiple people interact with one another on the same webpage, as long as
                            they have the same link. This opens up the possiblity of inter-user interactbility such as
                            chatrooms and other live inter-user building projects. While I do not think I will use this
                            for the final project, it did have me considering the exciting possibilities.
                            The second half of class was a demo period, where we were able to show our work casually to
                            the other students for project 02. I emjoyed this, especially since the recent strikes
                            caused a few in-class critiques to be cancelled. It was fun to be able to discuss with the
                            other students as well as show my own work as a way to gain potential ideas for the final
                            project.

                            Second to last class... I can see finals approaching! As I'm trying to balance many thinks
                            at the same time, I'm also trying to figure out how to use MONGO in a more effective way in
                            exercise 05. The first portion of the exercise went fairly smoothly, but it's trying to
                            wrestle with Javascript for the visualizations that will take some time. In any case, using
                            MONGO is required for the final project, and so trying to wrap my head around accessing a
                            database like this will surely help with the final. With an idea in mind and only a couple
                            weeks left of class, let's hope it all goes smoothly, and I'm looking forward to another
                            group demo.
